# nodecg-ticker

nodecg-ticker is a NodeCG bundle for adding a running ticker to your NodeCG graphics. It provides UI for managing the ticker contents, an API for libraries to integrate with for providing additional ticker modules, and handles the running of the ticker.

This bundle does not contain any graphics. It handles the state of the ticker and what is the active item in the ticker. It is up to you to decide how you want to display the ticker in your graphics, giving you full control over any appearance, animations, or transitions, allowing the ticker to fit right in with your existing content.
